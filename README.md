# SuitabilityScoreTest2
For compilation, the project will need to be cloned to open in Android Studio and confirm if gradle requires update. Minimum SDK is 24 and targe 34, so it should be able to compile from Nougat version and beyond.
After it's done it should be able to compile!

If more data is required to test, json file can be modified located in "SuitabilityScoreTest2\app\src\main\assets\ENG-MobileSDECodeExcercise-V2.json".
May add more, remove or however the information is required. Then it can get compiled once again.

An apk has been included just in root folder if required.
